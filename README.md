Note 1: We decided to test each model on every machine to give everyone a chance to practice (ref: \notebooks). Ultimately, we chose one model to optimize together over the rest of the week. The reason why we started uploading once on Github.

Note 2: To ensure that the app will work without issues please make sure that the requirements are all installed by simply running the requirements installer that you'll find in the scripts folder if it didn't work for a reason or another you can install them manually by navigating to the main folder in the cmd or powershell and run this command :
" pip install -r requirements.txt " .
